Agenda:

Onboarding to the Working Group 2 and notice to Terms of Reference document

Agree on a shared long term vision and targets for the WG inspired by KNMI E-AI meeting 

Agree on short term (~2-3 months) feasible deliverables (we will propose some ideas, you will be prompted to complement with your own)

Agree on how we organize work to achieve these objectives (weekly agile like KanBan/sprint planning + github repo ?)

Suggestions for this WG 

Dedicated session on cybersecurity and privacy including service provider and IT department.

FG, KS, HF, NR, BP

Workshop on techniques and technical solutions for adapting LLMs to your data without total retraining: prompt engineering/injection, RAG, Lora, Qlora, PEFT, … 

JS, FG,NR, JC, KK, FH, BP, HF

\* RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (not necessarily mean fine-tuning)

\* PEFT: Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning

\* LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation (a type of PEFT)

\* QLoRA: LoRA for quantized LLMs

Collect field and experimental feedback on real use-cases related to our domain on the various techniques mentioned above.

Workshop on small language/Multimodal Models : smaller architectures specialized in weather applications

Dedicated Workshop on Marine Weather reports - sharing code ? FG, KS, NR, JC, FH, BP

Focus on RAG of Foundation Models/ Large/Small Language Models, which are already pre-trained instead of own training or fine-tuning (resource-intensive)

Advice on technical setups? Both cloud solutions and on-prem access to GPUs.

Compliance, Validation, Testing and Ethical/Legal Questions (WG8 Ethics?) … KS, NR



Short term Deliverables & Next Steps

Participants and dates for 3 workshops in 2024 (date finding with doodle-like tool with participants with interest in participation, all participatants of first session are invited to join the 3 workshops):
